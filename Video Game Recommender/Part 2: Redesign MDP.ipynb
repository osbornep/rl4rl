Gaining an advantage enables the players to become stronger (obtain better items and level up faster) than their opponents and, as their advantage increases, the likelihood of winning the game also increases. We therefore have a sequence of events dependent on previous events that lead to one team destroying the other’s base and winning the game. \n","\n","Sequences like this being modelled statistically is nothing new; for years now researchers have considered how this is applied in sports, such as basketball (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01816.pdf), where a sequence of passing, dribbling and foul plays lead to a team obtaining or losing points. The aim of research such as this one mentioned is to provide more detailed insight beyond a simple box score (number of points or kill gained by player in basketball or video games respectively) and consider how teams perform when modelled as a sequence of events connected in time. \n","\n","Modelling the events in this way is even more important in games such as League of Legends as taking objectives and kills lead towards both an item and level advantage. For example, a player obtaining the first kill of the game nets them gold that can be used to purchase more powerful items. With this item they are then strong enough to obtain more kills and so on until they can lead their team to a win. Facilitating a lead like this is often referred to as ‘snowballing’ as the players cumulatively gain advantages but often games are not this one sided and objects and team plays are more important. \n","\n","#### The aim of this is project is simple; can we calculate the next best event given what has occurred previously in the game so that the likelihood of eventually leading to a win increases based on real match statistics?\n","\n","However, there are many factors that lead to a player’s decision making in a game that cannot be easily measured. No how matter how much data collected, the amount of information a player can capture is beyond any that a computer can detect (at least for now!). For example, players may be over or underperforming in this game or may simply have a preference for the way they play (often defined by the types of characters they play). Some players will naturally be more aggressive and look for kills while others will play passively and push for objectives instead.\n","Therefore, we further develop our model to allow the player to adjust the recommended play on their preferences.\n"]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c687a603f232c079ef3230dee70091886a05887a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Import Packages and

Reinforcement Learning AI Model\n","\n","\n","Now that we have our data modelled as an MDP, we can apply Reinforcement Learning. In short, this applied a model that simulates thousands of games and learns how good or bad each decision is towards reaching a win given the team’s current position. \n","\n","What makes this AI is its ability to learn from its own trial and error experience. It starts with zero knowledge about the game but, as it is rewarded for reaching a win and punished for reaching a loss, it begins to recognise and remember which decisions are better than others. Our first models start with no knowledge but I later demonstrate the impact initial information about decisions can be fed into the model to represent a person’s preferences.  \n","\n","So how is the model learning? In short, we use Monte Carlo learning whereby each episode is a simulation of a game based on our MDP probabilities and depending on the outcome for the team, our return will vary (+1 terminal reward for win and -1 terminal reward for loss). The value of each action taken in this episode is then updated accordingly based on whether the outcome was a win or loss. \n","\n","In Monte Carlo learning, we have a parameter 'gamma' that discounts the rewards and will give a higher value to immediate steps than later one. In our model, this can be understood by the fact that as we reach later stages of the games, the decisions we make will have a much larger impact on the final outcome than those made in the first few minutes. For example, losing a team fight in minute 50 is much more likely to lead to a loss than losing a team fight in the first 5 minutes.\n","\n","We can re-apply our model from part 1 with some minor

Often these segments are referred to as early, mid and late game and would be we would only need to consider fewer steps to reach an end goal. In this case it would not be to lead to a win but rather aiming to be at an advantage and the end of, say, 10 minute intervals. \n","\n","Another solution would be to use a model that learns quicker instead of the Monte Carlo method used. This often includes Q-learning or SARSA.\n","\n","We will not consider doing this here as they would require a lot of work to re-adjust the code. Instead, we will improve the rate the model learns by the way it selects its actions. Currently, we can either define the first action or it will choose randomly which means it is. However, after this first action all subsequent actions are also chosen randomly which is causing the number of episodes needed to exponentially increase for convergence to occur.\n","\n","Therefore, we will introduce a basic action selection method for these known as greedy selection. This means we select the best action the majority of the time therefore continually testing the success rate of the actions it thinks are best. It will also randomly select actions some of the time so that it can still explore states and doesnt get caught in a local maximum and not the optimal sulution. \n","\n","Also parameters play a key part in how quickly the output will converge, none moreso than our alpha parameter. Although a small alpha will be more accurate, a larger alpha value will learn and therefore subsequently converge faster. \n","\n","We will adjust our code to utilise both greedy selection and a reasonably large alpha as well as running for as many episodes as possible. More episodes means the runtime will be longer but because, at least at this stage, we are not attemping to have this running in real time there is no issue with it running for a while to find an optimal suggestion. \n","\n","It takes approximately 10 mins to run the model for 1,000 episodes, we have also included a tracking system for the run progress which shows the current percentage (based on which episode) the loop is in. This is particuarly useful if running for anything more than a few minutes.\n","\n","It was at this stage, I also notice that my method for applying the update rule was overriding previous knowledge if the action wasnt used in the current episode and so all results were converging back to zero after each episode. I fixed this by making it so if the state + action wasnt used in the episode, then it simply remians the same and will show in our results as being the flat parts of the lines. \n","\n","Lastly, we output the value of each of our available actions given our start state in each episode so we can track the learning process for these and how, over many episodes, our optimal action is decided.\n"]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"e2d2c0ba43140fac1dbf60ba302c0a2af97ac091"},"cell_type":"code","source":["from IPython.display import
