Gaining an advantage enables the players to become stronger (obtain better items and level up faster) than their opponents and, as their advantage increases, the likelihood of winning the game also increases. We therefore have a sequence of events dependent on previous events that lead to one team destroying the other’s base and winning the game. \n","\n","Sequences like this being modelled statistically is nothing new; for years now researchers have considered how this is applied in sports, such as basketball (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01816.pdf), where a sequence of passing, dribbling and foul plays lead to a team obtaining or losing points. The aim of research such as this one mentioned is to provide more detailed insight beyond a simple box score (number of points or kill gained by player in basketball or video games respectively) and consider how teams perform when modelled as a sequence of events connected in time. \n","\n","Modelling the events in this way is even more important in games such as League of Legends as taking objectives and kills lead towards both an item and level advantage. For example, a player obtaining the first kill of the game nets them gold that can be used to purchase more powerful items. With this item they are then strong enough to obtain more kills and so on until they can lead their team to a win. Facilitating a lead like this is often referred to as ‘snowballing’ as the players cumulatively gain advantages but often games are not this one sided and objects and team plays are more important. \n","\n","#### The aim of this is project is simple; can we calculate the next best event given what has occurred previously in the game so that the likelihood of eventually leading to a win increases based on real match statistics?\n","\n","However, there are many factors that lead to a player’s decision making in a game that cannot be easily measured. No how matter how much data collected, the amount of information a player can capture is beyond any that a computer can detect (at least for now!). For example, players may be over or underperforming in this game or may simply have a preference for the way they play (often defined by the types of characters they play). Some players will naturally be more aggressive and look for kills while others will play passively and push for objectives instead.\n","Therefore, we further develop our model to allow the player to adjust the recommended play on their preferences.\n"]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2dea389520b0d307535d2e501b4c01b94489ac3e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Import Packages and

In short, this applied a model that simulates thousands of games and learns how good or bad each decision is towards reaching a win given the team’s current position. \n","\n","What makes this AI is its ability to learn from its own trial and error experience. It starts with zero knowledge about the game but, as it is rewarded for reaching a win and punished for reaching a loss, it begins to recognise and remember which decisions are better than others. Our first models start with no knowledge but I later demonstrate the impact initial information about decisions can be fed into the model to represent a person’s preferences.  \n","\n","So how is the model learning? In short, we use Monte Carlo learning whereby each episode is a simulation of a game based on our MDP probabilities and depending on the outcome for the team, our return will vary (+1 terminal reward for win and -1 terminal reward for loss). The value of each action taken in this episode is then updated accordingly based on whether the outcome was a win or loss. \n","\n","In Monte Carlo learning, we have a parameter 'gamma' that discounts the rewards and will give a higher value to immediate steps than later one. In our model, this can be understood by the fact that as we reach later stages of the games, the decisions we make will have a much larger impact on the final outcome than those made in the first few minutes. For example, losing a team fight in minute 50 is much more likely to lead to a loss than losing a team fight in the first 5 minutes.\n"]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"55dc71fe5d6be56f336bbc753fc6889924534996"},"cell_type":"code","source":["alpha = 0.1\n","gamma = 0.9\n","num_episodes = 100\n","epsilon = 0.1\n","\n","reward = RedMatchMDP['Reward']\n","\n","StartState = 1\n","StartEvent = '+KILLS'\n","StartAction = '+OUTER_TURRET'"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"2d1446d24093b3ea9fba7c6984b2f8131cbf39aa"},"cell_type":"code","source":["def MCModelv1(data, alpha, gamma, epsilon, reward, StartState, StartEvent, StartAction, num_episodes):\n","    \n","    # Initiatise variables appropiately\n","    \n","    data['V'] = 0\n"," \n","    \n","    outcomes = pd.DataFrame()\n","    episode_return = pd.DataFrame()\n","    actions_output = pd.DataFrame()\n","    \n","    for e in range(0,num_episodes):\n","        \n","        action = []\n","\n","        current_state = StartState\n","        current_action = StartEvent\n","        next_action = StartAction \n","   \n","        actions = pd.DataFrame()\n"," \n","        for a in range(0,100):\n","            \n","            action_table = pd.DataFrame()\n","\n","            \n","            if (current_action==\"1\") | (current_action==\"0\") | (current_state==79):\n","                continue\n","            else:\n","                \n","                data_e = data[(data['StartState']==current_state)&(data['Event1']==current_action)]\n","\n","                data_e = data_e.sort_values('Probability')\n","                data_e['CumProb'] = data_e['Probability'].cumsum()\n","                data_e['CumProb'] = np.round(data_e['CumProb'],4)\n","\n","                \n","                rng = np.round(np.random.random()*data_e['CumProb'].max(),4)\n","                action_table = data_e[ data_e['CumProb'] >= rng]\n","                action_table = action_table[ action_table['CumProb'] == action_table['CumProb'].min()]\n","                action_table = action_table.reset_index()\n","                \n","                action = action_table['Event2'][0]\n","                \n","                if action == \"1\":\n","                    step_reward = 10*(gamma**a)\n","                elif action == \"0\":\n","                    step_reward = -10*(gamma**a)\n","                else:\n","                    step_reward = -0.005*(gamma**a)\n","                \n","                action_table['StepReward'] = step_reward\n","                \n","\n","                action_table['Episode'] = e\n","                action_table['Action'] = a\n","                \n","                current_action = action\n","                current_state = current_state+1\n","                \n","                \n","                actions = actions.append(action_table)\n","\n","        actions_output = actions_output.append(actions)\n","                \n","        episode_return = actions['StepReward'].sum()\n","\n","                \n","        actions['Return']= episode_return\n","                \n","        data = data.merge(actions[['StartState','EndState','Event1','Event2','Return']], how='left',on =['StartState','EndState','Event1','Event2'])\n","        data['Return'] = data['Return'].fillna(0)    \n","             \n","        data['V'] = data['V'] + alpha*(data['Return']-data['V'])\n","        data = data.drop('Return', 1)\n","        \n","        \n","                \n","        if current_action==\"1\":\n","            outcome = \"WIN\"\n","        elif current_action==\"0\":\n","            outcome = \"LOSS\"\n","        else:\n","            outcome = \"INCOMPLETE\"\n","        outcome = pd.DataFrame({'Epsiode':[e],'Outcome':[outcome]})\n","        outcomes = outcomes.append(outcome)\n","\n","        \n","        \n","\n","        \n","   \n","        \n","    \n","        \n","    optimal_policy_table = data[ ( data['StartState']==StartState) & (data['Event1']==StartEvent)&(data['Event2']==StartAction)]\n","     \n","    for i in range(2,79):\n","        optimal_V = data[data['StartState']==i]['V'].max()\n","        optimal_policy = data[ ( data['V']==optimal_V) & (data['StartState']==i)]      \n","        optimal_policy_table = optimal_policy_table.append(optimal_policy)\n","                \n","    return(outcomes,actions_output,data,optimal_policy_table)\n","    "],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"cb028596b37fd12bc12c0c61babf5febcf8f3316"},"cell_type":"code","source":["start_time = timeit.default_timer()\n","\n","\n","Mdl = MCModelv1(data=RedMatchMDP, alpha = alpha, gamma=gamma, epsilon = epsilon, reward = reward,\n","                StartState=StartState, StartEvent=StartEvent,StartAction=StartAction,\n","                num_episodes = num_episodes)\n","\n","elapsed = timeit.default_timer() -

Part 1 Conclusion\n","\n","So we have performed some interesting exploratory analysis, modelled the environment as an MDP and even created a RL model, however, there are still many challenges to overcome.\n"," \n","  \n"," \n","#### The biggest issue right now is our output doesn't account for cumulative success or failures. #\n","\n","In other words, our model thinks we are just as likely to take good objectives in later stages irrespective of whether we have lost each one before and would likely be behind.\n","\n","We can see this emphasised by our output getting us to a win from 20+ minutes by simply taking objective after objective even though we had lost the majority of objectives before it. There is no accountability for being in a losing position in our model.\n","\n","To fix this, we must re-asses our MDP and consider features that would account for the long term success or failure of taking or losing objectives. \n","\n","#### This is a good start, in our next part we will redesign our MDP to account for this and fix some other issues.
